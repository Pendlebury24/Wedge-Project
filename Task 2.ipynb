    "These files are not easy to use in their current chronological arrangement, though having them in a large system like GBQ will solve a lot of our problems. Nevertheless, it’ll be convenient to have a local sample of owners to do work. \n",
    "This task asks you to generate a file of owners where the file contains every record for each owner. There will be more than one owner in the file, and I do not want you to include card_no==3, which is the code for non-owners. The size of the sample is up to you, but I’d recommend shooting for a sample that’s around 250 MB. That’s big enough to be rich, but small enough to be fast. Ish.\n",
